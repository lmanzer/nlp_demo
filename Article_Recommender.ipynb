Those comments have led some to believe that Spielberg was ready to wage war on platforms like Netflix, especially after the streaming service's film \"Roma\" took home three Oscars last month. However, Spielberg reportedly met with Netflix's Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos earlier this week, a sign that, perhaps, these rumors of discord are just that, rumors.\n",

      "\n",
      "Summary: Reporting carbon emissions is a good first step, but proactively changing a business to be carbon-neutral is a far larger challenge. \"The disclosure element, the commitment of the company to disclose later this year what it says has taken a couple of years' worth of data to get its arms around, is a huge piece of the equation of what investors are looking for to show that companies are taking climate change seriously.\" Last year, 16 Amazon employees who owned stock in the company filed a shareholder resolution requesting Amazon's Board of Directors prepare a public report describing how the company is planning for disruptions posed by climate change, and how they plan to reduce the company's fossil fuel dependence.\n",

      "\n",
      "Summary: VW had said in its annual report that the SEC could take enforcement action against the company over the German automaker's involvement in the emissions scandal. The complaint claims Volkswagen made false and misleading statements to investors and underwriters about vehicle quality, environmental compliance and the company's financial standing, which gave Volkswagen a financial benefit when it issued securities at more attractive rates for the company. The SEC does not charge that any person involved in the bond issuance knew that Volkswagen diesel vehicles did not comply with U.S. emissions rules when these securities were sold, but simply repeats unproven claims about Volkswagen AG's former CEO, who played no part in the sales.\n",

      "Summary: Brnovich is one of several state attorneys general who spoke recently to the Washington Post about their willingness to take action against Facebook, Google and other tech giants, which they say have grown too powerful. What's being seen is the \"inaction or inability of the bureaucrats in Washington D.C. to do anything about protecting individual Americans, their privacy rights, how they are being manipulated when it comes to news feeds and news coverage,\" he said. Google also gave the paper a statement that said, \"Privacy and security are built into all of our products, and we will continue to engage constructively with state attorneys general on policy issues.\"\n",

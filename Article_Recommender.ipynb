Those comments have led some to believe that Spielberg was ready to wage war on platforms like Netflix, especially after the streaming service's film \"Roma\" took home three Oscars last month. As the governor of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences directors branch he has said that he would like films to have a longer theatrical run in order to qualify for an Academy Award."

Reporting carbon emissions is a good first step, but proactively changing a business to be carbon-neutral is a far larger challenge. But a recent Greenpeace report contended Amazon Web Services — among other technology companies with data center businesses that are energy-intensive and growing rapidly with the boom in cloud computing — has been opaque when it comes to publicly reporting its current energy use and how fast it's growing, although the company has committed to operating its global infrastructure at 100 percent renewable energy."
